# CfConcordion

The CfConcordion project allows you to run Concordion tests with ColdFusion components, rather than Java classes. It comes with a handy MXUnit base class that allows your concordion tests to be run through an MXUnit test case.

The code is currently pre-alpha. Do not *expect* anything to work just yet.
